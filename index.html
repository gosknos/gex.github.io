    <h2>Resume season 1</h2>
    <p class="color1">
        After Lincoln is imprisoned, Michael stages a bank robbery and is sent to Fox River where he meets inmates such as John Abruzzi – who helps to arrange a getaway plane, and Charles Westmoreland – also known as DB Cooper, who has $5 million hidden in cash.
        Michael reveals that his architecture firm had previously worked on retrofitting Fox River, meaning that he had access to its blueprints.
        Before the robbery, he spent four months having a huge tattoo inked on to his torso, which contains the plans to the prison and details of their escape plot.
        As the men prepare to escape Michael feigns diabetes in order to get daily access to the infirmary, with the intention of stealing a key from Sara.
        Michael and Sara become romantically involved. He tells her about his plan to break out of the prison, and asks her to leave the infirmary door unlocked on the night of the escape.
        Sara reluctantly helps, but her guilt drives her to overdose on pills.
        Meanwhile the Fox River Eight hatch their plan and successfully break out of the prison. But when they get to an air field their escape plane is nowhere to be seen.</p>

            The story picks up hours after the escape. The Fox River Eight split up to evade capture from FBI Special Agent Alex Mahone and to search for Cooper’s hidden $5 million.
            Michael and Lincoln are reunited with Sara – who survived her suicide attempt but has turned to alcohol and drugs after being fired.
            It is revealed that Mahone is working for The Company – the mysterious organisation that framed Lincoln – as is the new US President Caroline Reynolds.
            Sara allows herself to be arrested to ensure the brothers safety, but she and Lincoln are later pardoned.
            Michael, T-Bag and Mahone are not so lucky and are arrested in Panama along with Bellick – a Fox River prison guard who has been chasing the escapees to win a reward.
            They are sent to Sona prison – a dangerous place run by inmates and guarded only from the outside following a huge riot.
